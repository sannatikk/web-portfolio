                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                        <p>
                            In spring 2023, I made the decision to quit my comfortable job in the funeral industry and apply to get a engineering degree in Information Technology (B.Eng).
                            Now, I'm a second-year student specializing in Software Development, and I'm loving the learning process and seeing how my past experiences enhance my current studies!
                            I'm curious about working with SaaS (one specific SaaS was one of the main reasons I got into this field), and I'm expecially interested in all things UX. My not-so-secret long-term ambition is to combine my core strengths and become a Product Owner.
                            <br><br>When I'm not coding, you can find me adventuring on my bike, knitting, or planning a trip to Norway for some birdwatching.

                    <h3>My Studies</h3>
                        <p>
                            I'm in the Information Technology (B.Eng) degree program at Oulu University of Applied Sciences. My major is Software Development, and I'm in my second year of studies.  
                            My GPA is 5.0/5.0, and I am on course to graduate in time in May 2027.
                            <!-- <br><br>My current plans include completing an exchange year at a partner institution in Neu-Ulm, Germany, to earn a double degree (B.Eng in Finland & B.Sc in Germany). The year in Neu-Ulm will be focusing specifically on Artificial Intelligence and Information Management. -->

                        <p>
                            Feel free to browse <a href="https://github.com/sannatikk/">my GitHub</a> repositories for examples of schoolwork I've been doing! Coming up later this fall: a large (15 ECTS) web application project.
                            
                            <br><br>Some languages I've been using lately:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Java</li>
                                <li>JavaScript</li>
                                <li>HTML</li>
                                <li>CSS</li>
                                <li>C++</li>
                                <li>SQL</li>
                                <li>Python</li>
                            </ul>
                            My favorite project so far has been <a href="https://github.com/sannatikk/web-kurssi-testiprojekti">this site you're currently on</a>! Even though this is only a 5-credit course, building a responsive website from scratch has been a great learning experience, and I'm proud of the result. It's very fulfilling to immediately be able to see the fruits of your labor!
                            <br><br>A great larger project from my first year of studies was <a href="https://github.com/sannatikk/ATM_simulator_app">an ATM simulator</a>, where I got to practise building a Qt Widget frontend and Node Express backend, hand-building and querying relational databases, and using RESTful APIs. 
                            Fun extra credit challenges included hosting the database and backend remotely, using custom style sheets, and ensuring cross-platform compatibility.
                            <br><br>A fun electronics project from 2023 was the Arduino-based game <a href="https://github.com/sannatikk/SpedenSpelit">"Speden Spelit"</a>, which features LEDs, buttons, and a 7-segment display. Pressing the start button initiates LEDs blinking in random order at a steadily increasing pace. 
                            Players must press the gameplay buttons in the correct sequence to accumulate points, and the game ends if a mistake is made; the 7-segment display shows the score and signals if a new high score is achieved.
                            <br><br>
                        </p>
                    <h4>Career</h4>
                        <p>
                            In addition to my studies, I worked as an assistant teacher for the “Introduction to Programming” course in spring 2024. 
                            It was a great opportunity to help students learn the basics of programming while also honing my own teaching and communication skills. 
                            Teaching really made me look at the fundamentals from a completely different perspective, deepening my understanding and appreciation of the subject.                            
                            <br><br>Ask me about my previous career in the funeral industry! Very few things teach you as much about customer experience, meticulousness, and working under pressure as working with grieving families.
