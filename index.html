                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                        <p>
                            In spring 2023, I made the decision to quit my comfortable job in the funeral industry and apply to get a degree in Information Technology (Bachelor of Engineering).
                            Now, I'm a second-year student specializing in Software Development, and I'm loving the learning process and seeing how my past experiences enhance my current studies!
                            I'm curious about working with SaaS, and I'm especially interested in woring with backend, data, and testing-related tasks. 
                            My long-term ambitions include finding a position where I can combine my technical skills with my drive for managing large projects efficiently.
                            <br><br>When I'm not coding, you can find me adventuring on my bike, knitting, or planning a trip to Norway for some birdwatching.

                    <h3>My Studies</h3>
                        <p>
                            I'm in the Information Technology (B.Eng) degree program at Oulu University of Applied Sciences. My chosen speciality is Software Development, and I'm starting my third year of studies this upcoming August.  
                            My GPA is 5.0/5.0, and I am on course to graduate on time in May 2027.

                    <h3>My Work + Experience</h3>
                        <p>
                            I am currently working on an exciting project in addition to my regular school courses: I'm part of a small team building a self-driving, deep learning robot car for a large automotive software company! 
                            It's a huge leap into the unknown for me, and I'm excited to explore such a new (for me) part of software development.
                            
                            <br><br>Some technologies I've been working with recently:
                            <ul>                               
                                <li>JavaScript, Node</li>
                                <li>Python</li>
                                <li>Relational databases, REST APIs</li>
                                <li>React Native, Expo</li> 
                                <li>Kotlin, Jetpack Compose</li>
                                <li>React (with Mocha/Chai/Jest for testing)</li>
                                <li>Java</li>
                                <li>C++, QT</li>
                                <li>HTML & CSS</li>
                            </ul>

                            What I'm working on this spring: mobile development (both hybrid and Android) theory, and a large 15 ECTS mobile app project. Stay tuned!
                            
                            <br><br>My favorite project so far has been <a href="https://github.com/sannatikk/movie-app-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a full-stack web app</a> for movie enthusiasts to explore movies, manage favorites, read and write reviews, create social groups, and browse theater showtimes! It's got a hand-built PostgreSQL database, Node backend, React frontend, basic testing for both back and frontend, a light+dark theme and scalable design.
                            <br><br>A great larger project from my first year of studies was <a href="https://github.com/sannatikk/ATM_simulator_app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an ATM simulator</a>, where I got to practise building a Qt Widget frontend and Node Express backend, hand-building and querying relational databases, and using RESTful APIs. 
                            Fun extra credit challenges included hosting the database and backend remotely, using custom style sheets, and ensuring cross-platform compatibility.
                            <br><br>A fun electronics project from 2023 was the Arduino-based game <a href="https://github.com/sannatikk/SpedenSpelit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Speden Spelit"</a>, which features LEDs, buttons, and a 7-segment display. Pressing the start button initiates LEDs blinking in random order at a steadily increasing pace. 
                            Players must press the gameplay buttons in the correct sequence to accumulate points, and the game ends if a mistake is made; the 7-segment display shows the score and signals if a new high score is achieved.

                        <p>
                            In addition to my studies, I worked as an assistant teacher for the âIntroduction to Programmingâ course in spring 2024. 
                            It was a great opportunity to help students learn the basics of programming while also honing my own teaching and communication skills. 
                            Teaching really made me look at the fundamentals from a completely different perspective, deepening my understanding and appreciation of the subject.                            
                            <br><br>Ask me about my previous career in the funeral industry! Very few things teach you as much about customer experience, meticulousness, and working under pressure as working with grieving families.
